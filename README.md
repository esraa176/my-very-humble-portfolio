# Wait... a README for a portfolio?

Kinda ironic, right? But hey — you're already here, so why not just go check it out for yourself?

Built with lots of code, and too many coffees.

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech That Made This Portfolio Possible

- **HTML5 & CSS3** — No frameworks, just hand-coded beauty  
- **Vanilla JS** — For shimmer animations, sparkles, and interactivity  
- **Flexbox & Grid** — To make things actually look decent  
- **IntersectionObserver** — For scroll-triggered animations 
- **Responsive Design** — Because you never know what screen someone’s creeping on  
- **Google Fonts** — For that Orbitron + Space Grotesk combo

## Why this matters?

Instead of slapping together a template, I built this from scratch to showcase:
- My frontend fundamentals
- My eye for playful UX
- My obsession with making things feel *mine*

## ⚠️ This is a living project

I'll be adding more:
- Animations (maybe with GSAP?)  
- Interactive project demos 

Stay tuned — or just stare at the astronaut until it hypnotizes you.
